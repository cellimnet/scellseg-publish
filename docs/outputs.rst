Outputs
-------------------------------
Internally, the network predicts 3 (or 4) outputs: 
(flows in Z), flows in Y, flows in X, and cellprob. 
The predictions the network makes of cellprob are the inputs to a sigmoid 
centered at zero (1 / (1 + e^-x)), so they vary from around -6 to +6.

_seg.npy output 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``*_seg.npy`` files have the following fields:

- *filename* : filename of image
- *img* : image with chosen channels (nchan x Ly x Lx) (if not multiplane)
- *masks* : masks (0 = NO masks; 1,2,... = mask labels)
- *colors* : colors for masks
- *outlines* : outlines of masks (0 = NO outline; 1,2,... = outline labels)
- *chan_choose* : channels that you chose in GUI (0=gray/none, 1=red, 2=green, 3=blue)
- *ismanual* : element *k* = whether or not mask *k* was manually drawn or computed by the cellpose algorithm
- *flows* : flows[0] is XY flow in RGB, flows[1] is the cell probability in range 0-255 instead of 0.0 to 1.0, flows[2] is Z flow in range 0-255 (if it exists, otherwise zeros), 
            flows[3] is [dY, dX, cellprob] (or [dZ, dY, dX, cellprob] for 3D), flows[4] is pixel destinations (for internal use)
- *est_diam* : estimated diameter (if run on command line)
- *zdraw* : for each mask, which planes were manually labelled (planes in between manually drawn have interpolated masks)

Here is an example of loading in a ``*_seg.npy`` file and plotting masks and outlines

::

    import numpy as np
    from cellpose import plot
    dat = np.load('_seg.npy', allow_pickle=True).item()

    # plot image with masks overlaid
    mask_RGB = plot.mask_overlay(dat['img'], dat['masks'],
                            colors=np.array(dat['colors']))

    # plot image with outlines overlaid in red
    outlines = plot.outlines_list(dat['masks'])
    plt.imshow(dat['img'])
    for o in outlines:
        plt.plot(o[:,0], o[:,1], color='r')

If you run in a notebook and want to save to a `*_seg.npy` file, run 

::

    from cellpose import io
    io.masks_flows_to_seg(images, masks, flows, diams, channels, file_names)

where each of these inputs is a list (as the output of `model.eval` is)

PNG output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can save masks to PNG in the GUI.

To save masks (and other plots in PNG) using the command line, add the flag ``--save_png``.

Or use the function below if running in a notebook

::

    from cellpose import io
    io.save_to_png(images, masks, flows, image_names)

ROI manager compatible output for ImageJ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can save the outlines of masks in a text file that's compatible with ImageJ 
ROI Manager in the GUI File menu.

To save using the command line, add the flag ``--save_png``.

Or use the function below if running in a notebook

::

    from cellpose import io, plot

    # image_name is file name of image 
    # masks is numpy array of masks for image
    base = os.path.splitext(image_name)[0]
    outlines = plot.outlines_list(masks)
    io.outlines_to_text(base, outlines)
    
To load this ``_cp_outlines.txt`` file into ImageJ, use the python script 
provided in cellpose: ``imagej_roi_converter.py``. Run this as a macro after 
opening your image file. It will ask you to input the path to the ``_cp_outlines.txt`` 
file. Input that and the ROIs will appear in the ROI manager.

Plotting functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In ``plot.py`` there are functions, like ``show_segmentation``:


::

    from cellpose import plot

    nimg = len(imgs)
    for idx in range(nimg):
        maski = masks[idx]
        flowi = flows[idx][0]

        fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
        plot.show_segmentation(fig, imgs[idx], maski, flowi, channels=channels[idx])
        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.show()
